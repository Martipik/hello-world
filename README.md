# hello-world
1st repository for a newbie trying to learn how to program.

Yasss, I am an inferior woman trying to learn how to program and kick asses. 
Programming is the present.
It's the era.
It's the year.
It's the month.
The week.
It's the day.
It's the time.
And I'm already late because I KNOW NOTHING.
But it will be done, f it!
F It!
F It!
F It!
